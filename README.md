### **INTRODUCTION**

As the world becomes increasingly digital, challenges such as cybercrime, data breaches, and online harassment are escalating. Countries across the globe are updating their cyber legislation to ensure both digital security and the protection of civil liberties, such as freedom of expression and privacy.

Bangladesh is progressing rapidly through initiatives like *Digital Bangladesh*, but its primary law—the *Digital Security Act 2018*—has faced criticism for its ambiguity and potential to suppress free expression.

This study examines the cyber legislation of five highly ranked countries on the World Happiness Index—Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, and the United States—to draw lessons and propose two legal reforms aimed at fostering a secure and rights-oriented digital environment in Bangladesh.

### **CURRENT CYBER LAWS IN BANGLADESH**

While Bangladesh is embracing digital transformation, its cyber legal framework struggles with being outdated, overlapping, and at times restrictive. Below is an overview of the existing legal instruments:

#### 1. Digital Security Act (DSA), 2018

**Strengths:**

* Covers cyber offenses such as hacking, online fraud, phishing, cyberbullying, and disinformation
* Penalizes defamation, religious offense, and online falsehoods
* Formed the Digital Security Agency and Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)

**Concerns:**

* Ambiguous sections (e.g., 21, 25, 28, 29, 31) are prone to misuse
* Grants police authority to arrest/search without warrants in certain scenarios
* Accused of infringing press and speech freedoms by global human rights bodies

#### 2. Pornography Control Act, 2012

**Strengths:**

* Criminalizes the creation, distribution, and possession of pornographic materials online
  **Concerns:**
* Vague definitions
* Weak digital enforcement, especially on social media

#### 3. ICT Act, 2006

**Strengths:**

* Recognized e-transactions and digital records
* Punished cybercrimes including hacking and data theft
  **Concerns:**
* Section 57 was controversial for curtailing free speech and led to arbitrary arrests
* Eventually repealed due to public outcry

#### 4. Telecommunication Act, 2001

**Strengths:**

* Regulates telecommunication infrastructure and services
  **Concerns:**
* Lacks clear surveillance guidelines
* Overlaps with other laws, creating legal confusion
* Allows potential overreach in privacy breaches

#### 5. Draft Data Protection Act (Under Review)

**Strengths:**

* Aims to manage personal data usage, consent, and transparency
  **Concerns:**
* Grants disproportionate control to the government
* Lacks an autonomous data protection authority
* May enable mass surveillance

---

### **PRESENT CHALLENGES**

1. **Redundant and Dated Laws:**
   Laws like the ICT Act, DSA, and Telecommunication Act overlap, creating legal gray zones.

2. **Absence of Comprehensive Data Protection:**
   Individuals lack control over how their data is collected or used.

3. **Limited Cyber Literacy in Law Enforcement:**
   Lack of specialized knowledge often results in wrongful accusations.

4. **Inadequate Cybercrime Infrastructure:**
   Agencies lack technical tools and resources to investigate serious digital crimes.

5. **Security Prioritized Over Rights:**
   Laws contain vague language that suppresses expression and civic activism.

### **SUGGESTED REFORMS FOR BANGLADESH**

Based on international benchmarks, two legislative reforms are proposed:

#### **1. Digital Infrastructure Security and Accountability Act**

**Inspired by:** CISA (USA), NCSC (Switzerland), Estonia’s cyber model

**Objective:** Establish a national authority to secure digital infrastructure across public and private domains.

**Key Elements:**

* Mandatory cybersecurity protocols for vital sectors (e.g., banking, healthcare)
* Formation of a *National Digital Security Authority (NDSA)*
* Compulsory breach reporting
* Regular audits and stress tests
* Balanced surveillance policies with privacy safeguards

**Benefits:**

* Prevents cyberattacks on critical systems
* Improves agency coordination
* Builds trust through transparency
* Promotes private sector collaboration
* Respects digital privacy

#### **2. Cyber Freedom and Rights Protection Act**

**Inspired by:** Nordic countries' digital freedom laws, UN digital rights charter

**Objective:** Protect digital expression while preventing misuse of cyber regulations.

**Key Elements:**

* Clear legal definitions for online offenses
* Requires court warrants before arrests for digital speech
* Trains police on digital rights
* Establishes an independent grievance redressal board
* Penalizes misuse of authority

**Benefits:**

* Prevents wrongful arrests of journalists and citizens
* Ensures judicial oversight
* Strengthens trust in online platforms
* Boosts civic participation and creative expression
* Enhances Bangladesh’s global human rights standing

### **CONCLUSION**

As Bangladesh progresses digitally, it must ensure that legal safeguards evolve in tandem with technological growth. The current framework, though foundational, lacks clarity and modern relevance.

Drawing inspiration from advanced and peaceful countries can help Bangladesh balance security with liberty. The *Digital Infrastructure Security and Accountability Act* and the *Cyber Freedom and Rights Protection Act* are two essential reforms that can help ensure a secure yet open digital ecosystem.

Collaboration among stakeholders—including policymakers, experts, civil society, and citizens—is essential to create a forward-thinking, equitable digital society.
